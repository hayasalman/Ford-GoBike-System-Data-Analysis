## Overview 

This dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.


## Approaches & Methodologies

- Performed a quick overview about the dataset like the dataset shape , data types, and detected any missing/duplicated values.

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : univariate analysis, bivariate , and multivariate analysis.

- Performed Explanatory Analysis.

## Business Insights

- It seems that the proportion of male is represent the majority of bike riders with **74.6%** . while the proportion of female bike riders is only **23.3%** , and the other(unspecific) proportion 
  is **2.1%**.

- Slightly above **160,000** of bike riders are members (Subscriber) , however **20,000** of bike riders are non-members (Customers) which's a huge difference.

- The female & other genders tend to spend slightly more time in the trip duration , whereas most of the men tend to usually spend less time. And the non-members (Customers) are more likely to 
  spend more time in the trip duration than the members(Subscribers).

- Generally , the members (subscribers) tend to use the bikes for their trips more often compared to the non-members (customers) over the weekdays. Also , we observed that both members and non- 
  members are less likely to use the bikes on the weekends.

- The median of duration is almost the same during all days. However, The trip duration on the weekends is slightly more than on the weekdays.

- There are less bike riders in their **70 - 80 years old** for both genders. In total ,  a lot of the trip duration is usually **200 minutes or less** , and the longest trip duration made by the 
  males is for **43 years old man** ,  while the longest trip duration made by the females is for **61 years old women**.

- The trip duration of the non-members on weekends is usually longer than the weekdays , whereas for the trip duration of the members relatively tends to be the same duration during all the 
  weekdays , but it slightly tends to be more on the weekends.

- Regardless of whether the bike rider is female or male , member or non member the trip duration will be longer on Thursdays than the other days.

- We may say that : based on the trip duration of the subscribers in this dataset , any individual who frequently need to use a bike are more likely to subscribed.
